# pandas-challenge
### Eddy's folder for Pandas Homework
- This challenge utilizes the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook to break down and analyze some data to draw some meaningful insights.
- I have chosen the Heroes of Pymoli challenge, which looks at a fantasy-themed game's purchasing data.
- The main script can be found in the HeroesOfPymoli folder, and the csv with the raw data is also within in the resources folder.
